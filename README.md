### Translations
Translations from Chinese to English (in the website) are done by me, without translating tools. I attempted to translate the media scripts to English to the best of my ability. Some sentences may feel off when reading it.

### Codes
Source code by me can be found in the files in this repository. 
The timeline was inspired by <a href="https://codepen.io/jen-huang/pen/LENZGX"> this </a>!
I used Repl.it to make this site, then uploaded the individual files to github.
