The revolution led to the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC) in 1911-1912. The cause of the revolution included the corruption of the Qing dynasty and subjugation of the Western and Japanese in China. <br><br>The First Opium War (1840- 1842) marks the start of Modern Chinese history. The treaties, such as the Treaty of Nanjing (August 29, 1842), from this period and on, have caused many changes to take place in China’s society. The destruction of China’s land and power led to China’s loss of political independence, which led to the dissatisfaction of the Chinese people. Another factor that started the XinHai Revolution was the WuChang Uprising (武昌起义) that took place in Wuchang, Hubei, China on October 10, 1911.</p>

The period from 1927 to 1937 was known as the Ten-Year Civil War (十年内战). Notable events during this period include the Communist Party's uprising in Nanchang against the Nationalist government in Wuhan on August 1, 1927. 
    <br><br> Also referred to Civil War of the Nationalists and Communists (国共内战), the Chinese Civil War is a war that broke out within China’s borders between the two major political parties, the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT/GMD) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and their armed forces for national power. The Civil War ended with the KMT’s retreat to Taiwan. In a broad sense, the Chinese Civil War refers to a long-term war that occurred in China from the end of the 1920s to the end of the 1940s, and it is also the largest-scaled civil war in modern history.
<br><br>The Chinese Civil War is roughly divided into two stages: the Civil War from 1927 to 1937 the first stage, and from June 1946 to September 1949 divided as the second stage. This war is involved two parties: the KMT (fought by the National Revolutionary Army (国民革命军) and National Army of the Republic of China (中华民国国军)) and the CCP (the first stage fought by the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (中国工农红军), the second stage fought by the People’s Liberation Army (中国人民解放军)). </p>

During the war, Chiang Kai-Shek (Jiang JieShi) viewed the Chinese Communists as a greater threat, as opposed to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. After the Xi'An Incident in December 1936, Chiang agreed to work with the CCP. After the war ended with the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Chinese Civil War started again. </p>

<br><br>By launching the "Cultural Revolution", the main goal was to prevent the restoration of capitalism and to seek China's way of building socialism. As the leader of a ruling proletarian party, the CCP, Mao Zedong constantly observed the real-life problems of the emerging socialist society after the establishment of the PRC in 1949. Corruption, privilege, bureaucracy, and other occurrences in China are constantly explored and fought tirelessly. Civil strife was led by an unclear understanding of the laws of socialist construction and development.

After the collapse of the Beiyang government, the political situation was relatively turbulent, and Sun Yat-sen went south to Guangzhou. After the founding of the Communist Party of China in 1921, Sun Yat-sen promoted the reorganization of the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1924, the KMT carried out the Northern Expedition (led by Chiang Kai-Shek after Sun’s death in 1925), and overthrew the rule of the Beiyang warlords.
