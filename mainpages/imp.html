    <h6 id="both-similarities" class="mainpagetit">  Alliances </h6> <p class="mainpagetext"> The first collaboration between Chiang and Mao’s parties, the Kuomintang (Guo Min Dang) and CCP (Chinese Communist Party, Gong Chan Dang), started in 1923 known as the First United Front. Due to ulterior motives from both parties, the front was disintegrated in about 1927. The KMT hoped to control the CCP through this alliance, and the CCP hoped to strengthen itself through internal connection with members of the KMT. Both parties neglected their initial mutual goal, which was to fight warlordism and strengthen China. </p>
<p class="mainpagetext"> The second alliance between the KMT and CCP, led by Chiang Kai-Shek (Jiang Jie Shi) and Mao ZeDong, was the Second United Front in 1937. The alliance was announced after Chiang Kai-Shek was kidnapped and held hostage by his generals until he promised to collaborate with the CCP in a war against the invading Japanese (Xi’An Incident) Army. The Second United Front collapsed in 1945, opening the final phase of the Chinese civil war. </p>

    
    <h6 id="both-similarities" class="mainpagetit">  Similarities </h6> Both individuals had different ideologies which they adhered till their deaths.

     <h6 id="both-similarities" class="mainpagetit">  Significance </h6> Ever since Jiang's retreat to Taiwan from mainland China, the Taiwanese has been planning a retake of mainland China, while the CCP is also finding methods to suppress Taiwan's goals. Throughout the years from 1949, conflicts and disputes between mainland China, governed by the CCP, and Taiwan, governed by the ROC, accumulated and continues to grow.
