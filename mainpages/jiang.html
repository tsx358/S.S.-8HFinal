  <div class="mainpagetext" id="jiangbio">
     <h6 id="jiang-birth" class="mainpagetit">  Birth </h6>Jiang JieShi, also known as Chiang Kai-Shek, was born on October 31, 1887, in Ningpo (宁波), China, to Jiang ZhaoCong (蒋肇聪) of a peasant family. 
    <h6 style="font-size: 2.5vw" id="earlyyears-jiang" class="mainpagetit"> Early Years </h6> Jiang grew up following Confucian morals. At a very young age, he read the Four Books and Five Classics (Confucian Canons/ 四书五经), which were important classics of Chinese Confucianism. In 1906, Jiang went to Paoting Military Academy (保定陆军军官学校) in North China. In April of 1906, Jiang also went to Japan and returned to China in the winter. <img align= right height= auto width= 20% src="youngjiang.jpg"> In 1908, Jiang traveled again, east to Japan, and was admitted to Tokyo Shinbu Gakko (振武学校). 振武学校 (1896-1914), originally named  成城 in Chinese, was a military school established in 1896 for Chinese students to receive basic military training in Japan. On November 25, 1909, Jiang joined the Japanese Army, and served 
    Japanese. During the XinHai Revolution (辛亥革命), Jiang took part in the fight to overthrow the Qing. After the successful revolution, on January 1, 1912, the Republic of China (ROC) was established. During the First United Front (1923/1924 - 1927), Chiang Kai-Shek spent three months in the Soviet Union (USSR), studying the Soviet political and military systems. Back in China, Jiang became commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy. The Whampoa Military Academy (黄埔军校), also known as the Republic of China Military Academy, was founded by the Kuomintang (KMT) under Sun Yat-Sen and officially opened on May 1, 1924.  Throughout the 1920s, Jiang received further support from the Green Gang of ShangHai, a feared crime group that spread into the upper levels of Shanghai society, and into social level of national and local governments.
      <h6 style="font-size: 2.5vw" id="leader-jiang" class="mainpagetit"> Leading China </h6>In 1925 after Sun Yat-sen’s death, Chiang became the leader of the Republic of China. He became known as Generalissimo. Jiang spent the following years trying to keep Communism and the Chinese Communists out of China. Because of the <a href="gloss.html#ccpfound">founding of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)</a> in ShangHai, 1921, political competition in China has begun to increase in mainland China. In 1924, the First United Front, the first alliance between the KMT and CCP, was formed, led by Jiang and Sun Yat-Sen. The alliance's goal was to end warlordism in China. On July 9, 1926, Jiang launched the Northern Expedition, a military campaign to unify China after the Xinhai Revolution. The Northern Expedition's main target was the three forces of the Beiyang warlords (北洋军阀): one was 吴佩孚, who occupied Henan, Hunan, and Hubei, and has troops consisting of about 200,000 soldiers. The second target，张作霖, occupied Northeastern (DongBei) provinces and Beijing; its troops has approximately 300,000 soldiers. The third target, 孙传芳, was the direct warlord of the five provinces; 孙传芳 had approximately 200,000 soldiers. The Nationalist Army had 8 armies, about 100,000 soldiers in total. From the number of soldiers, the Beiyang warlords have a significant advantage over the Nationalists. However, the warlords of Beiyang has internal conflicts, which provided opportunities for attack for the Nationalist Army. <img src="jiangnorthernexpd.jpg" align=left width=20% height=auto > In 1927, in the middle of the Northern Expedition, the <a href="gloss.html#412inci">ShangHai Massacre </a> of April 12 (April 12 Purge, 四一二事件) broke out as a violent suppression of the CCP by General Jiang and forces supporting Jiang. As a result, this event led to conflicts, eventually leading to the Chinese Civil War. On September 18, 1931, the Japanese invaded Manchuria (东北) and posed a threat to both the Nationalists and Communists. This event was known as the Manchurian (Mukden) Incident, which also started the Japanese attempt at military expansion in East Asia. In December 1936, Jiang was captured by two of his generals, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, to force Jiang to fight the Japanese and face the external threat posed by the Japanese. This was known as the <a href="gloss.html#xian36">Xi'An Incident</a> (Sian/XiAn). In 1937, the Nanjing Massacre (the Rape of Nanjing), involved the mass murder of Chinese Civilians by the Imperial Japanese Army. This event caused the KMT and CCP to form stronger patriotic forces. By 1941, Jiang and Mao ZeDong, leader of the Chinese Communists, united to defeat the Japanese in 1945. While having the KMT (led by Jiang) fought the Japanese on the coasts in NanJing, the CCP was focusing on increasing its supporters in China. After defeating the Japanese, the conflicts of controlling mainland China (Chinese Civil War) started again. Many people joined the CCP, after losing trust in the KMT. Many believed that if Jiang and the KMT had focused more on fighting against the Japanese than fighting against the CCP, less damage would have resulted This was a major factor that contributed to the Nationalists' loss in the Chinese Civil War. The KMT was weakened by fighting the Japanese, and the CCP has grown in numbers during this time. On February  28, 1947, the <a href="gloss.html#228mas" >February 28 Incident</a> started. Suppression from the KMT caused anti-government uprisings. Throughout these incidents, later known as White Terror, thousands of Taiwanese were massacred. In 1949, the Nationalist government was overthrown by the CCP.  
    <h6 style="font-size: 2.5vw" id="retreat-jiang" class="mainpagetit"> 
 Retreating </h6> In 1949, following the defeat in the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan with his army and government to plan for retaking mainland China. In 1950, Jiang became President of the ROC in Taiwan. After seeing the destruction caused by Mao ZeDong's Great Leap Forward of 1958, Jiang planned for an attack to reconquer mainland China. On April 1, 1961, Jiang started the <a href="gloss.html#guoguang">Project National Glory (Guo Guang) </a> event, in attempt to retake mainland China. In October 1971, Jiang's representatives in the United Nations were repelled, since the ROC has "illegally occupied all its affiliated agencies". In 1975, Jiang passed away due to a cardiac malfunction and renal failure in TaiPei, Taiwan. Jiang JieShi is buried in Cihu Mausoleum (慈湖陵寝), Taiwan.
<h6 style="font-size: 2.5vw" id="jiang-death" class="mainpagetit"> Impact </h6>Jiang’s influential accomplishments remains memorable, regardless of his defeat in 1949 by the Communists after the Chinese Civil War. His contribution to the benefit of China as a whole was impactful and its effects are still seen in China today. Jiang’s retreat from mainland China has built the CCP’s conflicts with Taiwan. Jiang's accomplishments impacted both the development of China and Taiwan to the present day. Chiang's Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928 successfully defeated the Beiyang warlords, effectively unifying China in 1928, and after Jiang retreated to Taiwan from mainland China, he governed Taiwan separately from the CCP.

          <h2 class="mainpageheaders" id="jiangpriv"> Private Life</h2>
  <p class="mainpagetext">When Jiang was born, he was given the birth name Jiang RuiYuan (蔣瑞元). In 1901, Jiang married Mao Fumei (毛福梅) and they were divorced in 1927. They had a son, named Chiang Ching-Kuo, who was their only biological son of Jiang. Mao Fumei was killed in a Japanese air raid in XiKou in 1939. In 1913, Jiang married Yao YeCheng and divorced her in 1927. In 1921, Jiang married Chen Jieru and divorced her in 1927, when Jiang married Song Mei-ling in the same year. Jiang married Soong Mei-ling (known as Madame Chiang Kai-shek,  Madame Chiang, or 宋美龄) in 1927 until Jiang died in 1975. Song Meiling was Song QingLing (Sun Yat-Sen (孙中山)'s wife)'s younger sister. In other words, Chiang Kai-Shek was Sun Yat-Sen's brother-in-law. Chiang Wei-Kuo (蒋纬国) was Jiang’s adopted son. </p>

  <p class="mainpagetext">To all compatriots of the citizens and military of China, and all people of the world who love peace:  today we are victorious. The truth of “Justice Triumphs Over Power” received its last proof, representing the success of KMT revolutionaries. We (Our China) fought in the times of darkness and hopelessness- the belief that kept us going through these 8 years of struggles- have today received achievement. To the world peace put in front of us, we will thank our country’s revolutionaries, the previous generation of loyalty and sacrifice of martyrs; we will thank our allies, who fought along our side for peace and justice; especially, we will thank our founding father of our country (Sun Yat-Sen/ Sun ZhongShan), who worked hard leading our revolutionary to a correct path, allowing us to have the success of today. All Christians of the world need to thank the fair and merciful God. 
</p> 
  <p class="mainpagetext">Fellow citizens of the whole country from the times of resisting against the Japanese: the pain felt and sacrifices made during the 8 years- even though numbers increased from year to year, the belief in victory against the Japanese reinforced year to year as well; especially our fellows at occupied areas(沦陷区), who experienced enough destruction and shame of darkness, today receiving full liberation, seeing the clear skies again. These few days, the emotions of cheers and joy from citizens all around is mainly for our fellows who received liberation. Now, even though we achieved victory from the Japanese, it doesn't count as our last victory. We need to know our new meaning and reason for fighting is not only our powers in the world after we have achieved a victory on the behalf of the slight war victory we achieved; I believe world citizens and fellow citizens are hoping that this war on civilized countries of the world is the last war we participate in.
